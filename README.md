# JavaScript-consumindo-e-tratando-dados-de-uma-API
I understand how asynchronous JavaScript works. I consumed the ViaCEP API with the fetch API. I got to know the Promises and their methods. I learned how to use async await to create async functions. I treated possible request errors returned from the API, learning how to turn a static form page into a dynamic one.
